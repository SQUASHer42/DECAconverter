# DECAconverter
Welcome to the Beta 1.1 build of the DECA-converter program. This program accepts Strings saved in input.txt and key.txt and outputs information to out.txt in the following format:

    test number;exam type;question number;question text;choice A;choice B;choice C;choice D;answer;answer text
    ex) 1079;FINANCE;REGIONALS;25;What is the square root of -1?;0;i;-1;1;i;i represents the imaginary value of the square root of -1.
    
Currently known problems:

    1.) Only tests 2009 and up can be used with this program.
    2.) It is unknown whether this program will work for exams other than Finance Cluster Exams.
     3.) Some errors may occur if the input has formatting errors (For example, an extra space in a sentence or specific misspelled words).

DECA Competitors are welcomed and encouraged to test this program out and to find bugs.
